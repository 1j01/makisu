# Makisu: Sushi Making Simulator

## TIC-80 version (2D / 2.5D)

<!-- TODO: GIF -->

This is a sushi making simulator built in [TIC-80 tiny computer](http://tic80.com/), written in JavaScript.

It uses Verlet integration for point-based physics.

Use the makisu (bamboo mat) to roll and form the sushi.

üïπÔ∏è [Play it here](https://1j01.github.io/makisu/tic-80/), or download the [cartridge file](./makisu.tic) and load it in TIC-80.

Features:
- Lovely pixel art for lots of sushi ingredients (not all are used in the game)
- Bowls of ingredients
- You can adjust the 3D effect (oblique projection) freely with the arrow keys, including making it fully 2D if you wish
- Physics are kinda janky but you can technically roll sushi if you're careful
- Secret music (not enabled in the game) imitating Katamari Damacy's theme music

## THREE.js version (3D)

<!-- TODO: GIF -->

This is a sushi making simulator using [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/), written in JavaScript.

It uses [cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es) for physics.

üïπÔ∏è [Play it here](https://1j01.github.io/makisu/).

Features:
- Toolbar with camera and interaction tools
- Physics are kinda janky, but you could maybe convince yourself that you've sort of rolled a sushi roll, if you're very careful as well as undiscerning and generous with your imagination
- Grains of rice are just spheres, and fish slices are just boxes that look like damn erasers more than sashimi
- Some support for mobile devices
